# FizzBuzz


By [Phil Worthington](https://github.com/philworthington).



## Description

The challenge:

Using Ruby: Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”, and in all other cases return the number.

Then write a solution that is extensible if users have a list of 30 other numbers they'd like this program to handle.
